In this time of crisis when the whole world is in dismay, all one needs to do is to be aware about the seriousness of the situation and be grateful to our corona warriors who risk their life daily to ensure our safety. In an effort to do our bit for the cause, we have made this web application to make people aware about the current situation of top  five states in the country and help masses get easy access to some crucial information regarding COVID-19. 

Some key features of the site are listed below:
1. We have used API to render the latest updates on number of active cases, recovered cases and total deaths state wise.
2. Covid centres for top 5 states with their helpline numbers and addresses along with thier locations on the map are also provided for convenience.
3. Symptoms and precautions of COVID-19 discussed in detail.
4. A section dedicated to FAQâ€™s.
5. A separate page is added to thank our frontline corona warriors to show our utmost gratitude for their role in our lives.
6. All webpages are completely responsive for better visibility in all devices.
